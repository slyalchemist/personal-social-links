## My process
- I first started by only focusing on the HTML to establish the main components of the profile card. Once I had these components established, I was able to begin styling on the CSS. 
- Once I began styling, it was fairly easy to replicate the example with my own style. I only tripped up on the vertical centering of elements with the flexbox.
- After I styled to how I liked the page, I finalized the profile by inserting my profile links and a profile image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I was already largely familiar with all of the tools I used within this project, it was just a matter of remembering how to use them and troubleshooting minor issues that didn't accomodate to how I wanted the final result. 



### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to make this card a bit more responsive to different screen sizes. I may want to adapt the layout depending on the minimum width of the viewport, such as having the "about-me" and "profile-links" containers be organized horizontally when space permits. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me troubleshoot small issues I had with styling. It's one of my go-to resources.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is another amazing website that help me troubleshoot small issues I had with styling, and also another go-to resource. 
- [Color Hex Codes](https://www.color-hex.com/) - This is a very useful website that inspires color palettes of mine!
